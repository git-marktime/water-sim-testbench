# water-sim-testbench
extremely simple proof of concept to show that i can do math

im currently working on another independent large scale project which accurately simulates the operations of a hydroelectric dam

in order to make an accurate simulation, im gonna need a playground to look at the numbers go wheeee (which is where this comes in)

had a lot of hiccups to get this working, and went through 3 different programming languages until i settled on golang

7/23/2023 UPDATE: breaking news, i broke and decided to use a game engine
7/24/2023 UPDATE: i finished it
